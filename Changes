    - pfunc can now distinguish between class and object methods.
    - B::Utils no longer loading Exporter to avoid loading a bunch of
      modules.
    - B::Utils's fake carp/croak were broken.
    - B::Utils::opgrep() was not finding ops properly
    - Test made more polite for systems who's path_sep is not :
    - Fixing case where an op filter may encounter a NULL op when
      checking for entersubs.
    - Quote filename in the call to B::Module::Info, allows
      using directories with spaces.
    - Fixed the case where a module does not have any BEGIN blocks.
    * Fixed non-bareword require in a BEGIN block.
    * Fixed require $foo.
    * Fixed BEGIN blocks not containing a require.
    * Scan subroutines when searching for required modules.
    * Fixed various problems with perl 5.6.1 on Win32
      (probably due to ithreads).
    - Use IPC::Open3 under Windows 95/98/ME, since 2>&1 does not work.

    - Rafael Garcia-Suarez noticed I forgot to deal with code refs in
